# -CVIP-Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women, and accurate prediction models can aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can predict whether a given set of features extracted from a breast cancer biopsy are indicative of a malignant or benign tumor.
